# Widget Description

The CarouselView Widget in Flutter allows developers to create a scrollable list of items that users can swipe through, similar to a slideshow or photo gallery.

## Setup Instructions

- **Step 1:** Ensure that you have Flutter SDK installed (version >= 3.0.0).
- **Step 2:** Clone the git repo `git clone https://github.com/ZeeyahOke/CarouselView_Widget_Presentation`.
- **Step 3:** Use the command `cd carousel` to navigate to the directory of the code.
- **Step 5:** Run the command `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
- **Step 6:** Connect a device or emulator and run by using the command `flutter run`.

## Attributes of CarouselView

1. `itemExtent`: This attribute sets each carousel item's width. 
2. `itemSnapping`: When true, this attribute lets items snap into place when you swipe, rather than free scrolling.
3. `children`: This attribute specifies the list of widgets that will be displayed in a carousel.
